// TODO: 
// Create textboxes for user to fill in (can use TextBox from UI components)
// Should there be required fields that must be filled before they can create a session?
// If so, make sure required fields are filled in

// After all details have been filled, they need to be stored in firebase (this is done in Database -> firebase.dart)
// Should we create a booth session class this way each booth session is an object
// that has all of these details as instance variables, and then can easily be displayed
// in each tile in the session home page?

// Create a button to add the session to the session home page (can use Button from UI components)
// Once this button is pressed, go to the session home page
